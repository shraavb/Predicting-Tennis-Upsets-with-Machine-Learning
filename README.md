# Tennis Upset Prediction Model ðŸŽ¾

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shraavb/Predicting-Tennis-Upsets-with-Machine-Learning/HEAD)

## Problem Statement
In professional tennis, predicting upsets (matches where a lower-ranked player defeats a higher-ranked one) is a challenging problem. This project builds a machine learning model to forecast the likelihood of an upset based on historical match and player statistics.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [ATP/WTA Tennis Data](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) from Jeff Sackmann's repository
- **Coverage**: ATP and WTA tours from 2000-2025 (~138,000 matches)
- **Features**: Player rankings, match stats, surface type, tournament level, head-to-head records, and recent form
- **Data preprocessing**: Steps included in `notebooks/` and `src/data_loader.py`

## Approach / Model
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Jupyter Notebooks (`/notebooks`)
- **Feature engineering** for player statistics, rankings, and surface-adjusted performance
- **Model training** using algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks
- **Evaluation metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC

## Results
- **Best model**: **XGBoost** with 67% recall for upsets and 0.78 ROC-AUC
- **Upset rate**: 33% of matches result in upsets
- **Key predictors**: Ranking difference, head-to-head record, recent form, tournament level

## Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Incorporating live match data for real-time predictions
- Deploying as a web app for interactive use
- Advanced ensemble methods and feature selection
